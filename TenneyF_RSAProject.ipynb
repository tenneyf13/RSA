The first part will show the mathematics in terms of code to accomplish our goal. This rest will combine the algorithms to do the following, 1) pick two prime numbers and multiply them together, this will give you, n which is half of the public and private key. 2) Use FME and (q-1)(p-1) to find e public key. 3) Use extended Euclidean to find d private key, which is the modular inverse of e and (q-1)(p-1) . 4) Now can encode and decode.
